### **Automating Resume Shortlisting Using AI**

* **Problem Statement:** ABC Corporation is a rapidly growing company that receives a high volume of resumes for its job openings. The recruiters are struggling with the time-consuming task of manually screening and shortlisting suitable candidates. The company wants to improve the quality of its hiring decisions while reducing the time and effort required to screen resumes. To overcome this challenge, the company wants to use AI tools to automatically shortlist resumes based on job requirements.

* **Solution:** The company decided to leverage AI tools to automate the process of resume shortlisting. The goal was to use machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to identify resumes that match the job requirements and rank them according to their suitability for the role.
The first step was to collect a large dataset of resumes and job descriptions. The data were preprocessed to remove irrelevant information and convert it into a machine-readable format. The dataset was then used to train a machine learning model using Python programming language.

* The machine learning model was trained using a variety of techniques such as feature extraction, text classification, and sentiment analysis to extract relevant features from the text and make accurate predictions. The model was trained to identify the relevant keywords, phrases, and skills required for a particular job and match them with the resumes.


* **Result:** The AI-powered system significantly reduced the time and effort required to screen resumes and improved the quality of hiring decisions. The system provided accurate and unbiased results that helped recruiters identify the most suitable candidates for the job. The system also helped the company to reduce its recruitment costs and improve its overall efficiency.

* **Conclusion:** The use of AI tools for resume shortlisting has the potential to significantly streamline the recruitment process. By automating the process of shortlisting resumes, companies can identify and hire the best candidates more quickly and efficiently. However, it's important to ensure that the AI models used in this process are fair, unbiased, and free from any form of discrimination to ensure that all candidates are evaluated fairly and without bias.
